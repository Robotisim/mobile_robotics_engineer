### Robotics Softaware Engineer
This repository contains packages with robotics development learning purpose.
1. **robot_motion** :
    - C++ Brushup : Single File vs Cmakelists based C++ Programming
    - Easy debugging , efficient code and scalable development
    - One file **robot.cpp** shows an output and then we build the same behaviour using **robot_motion** project based on cmakelist
    - Then we added sensor.h to represent ease of integeration.
    - To run this you need to build it by going into *build* dir and write **cmake ..** then *make*
2. **robot_motion** :
    - Forward Kinematics
    - Inverse Kinematics
3. **drive_turtle** :
    - ROS2 Basic Simulation understanding
    - Launch file concepts learning .
    - Programmed Inverse Kinematics
4. **drive_tb3** :
    - ROS2 based package for learning Sensor Based Data prcessing
    - 2D Lidar for Maze Solving
    - Mono-Camera for Maze Solving using QR
5. **path_planning**
    - Implementation of Astar, Djikstra , RRT
6. **autonomous_tb3**
    - Using turtlebot 3 , Slam Navigation
    - NAV2 localiation
    - Python , c++ simple api for nav2
    - Actions
    - Architecture
