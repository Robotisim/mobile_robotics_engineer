### Robotics Softaware Engineer
This repository contains packages with robotics development learning purpose.
1. **robot_motion** :
    - C++ Brushup : Single File vs Cmakelists based C++ Programming
    - Easy debugging , efficient code and scalable development
    - One file **robot.cpp** shows an output and then we build the same behaviour using **robot_motion** project based on cmakelist
    - Then we added sensor.h to represent ease of integeration.
    - To run this you need to build it by going into *build* dir and write **cmake ..** then *make*
2. **drive_turtle** :
    - ROS2 Basic Simulation understanding
    - Launch file concepts learning .
2. **custom_robots** :
    - Transforms
    - URDF
5. **drive_tb3** :
    - ROS2 based package for learning Sensor Based Data prcessing
    - 2D Lidar for Maze Solving
    - Mono-Camera for Maze Solving
6. **path_planning**
    - Implementation of Astar , RRT
7. **autonomous_tb3**
    - Using turtlebot 3 , Slam Navigation
    - NAV2 localiation
    - Python , c++ simple commander api for nav2
    - Actions
    - Architecture
8. **behaviour_trees**
    - Creating Basic behaviour Trees
    - Understanding ROS2 navigation backend with Behvaiour Trees
9. **Custom Interfaces**
    - Creating combined ros2 message interface
10. **Point Clouds**
    - Process Point clouds using PCL
    - Utilize Kitti Dataset to perform segmentation
11. **kuka_arm_ros2**
    - Utilize Kuka Arm to perform Motion
    - Integerate Moveit2 for Manupilation
12. **drive_drone**
    - Bring Drone and learn Gazebo motion
    - Perform computer vision based Robot Follower
