### Single File vs Cmakelists based C++ Programming
- Easy debugging , efficient code and scalable development
- One file **robot.cpp** shows an output and then we build the same behaviour using **robot_motion** project based on cmakelist
- Then we added sensor.h to represent ease of integeration.
- To run this you need to build it by going into *build* dir and write **cmake ..** then *make*
