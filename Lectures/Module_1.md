# Module # 1 : Basics of C++ from Robotics Prespective
- Package Created : *cpp_fundamentals*
- Emphasis :
    - People are good and writing code , but they are not organized
    - Working with people who donot follow programming standards is so hard - you will experience if you work at a startup
    - Senior always enforce standards and it is essential otherwise how would multiple people work upon it ?
    - If you just get c++ learning out of this course , it is still one the best thing

## V1.0
- `a_welcome_course_how_you_will_learn`
    - lectures , assignments , quizes , weekly meetings
- `b_windows_mac_setup`
    - Install vm and run ubuntu 22.04
- `c_install_vscode`,plugins
    - form now do all things on linux
- `d_cpp_exe`
    - CPP compilation and Execution
    - *overlay* : process of CPP execution
    - amazing , now look at this ros2 C++ node basic code
        - Makes no sense right , but at the end of this module you will be very clear what are these things
- `e_functions`
    - *overlay* : As projects grow in complexity, we modularize our code for readability, reusability, and maintainability. Functions are the building blocks that help us organize logic into callable units.
    - Functions
- `f_namespaces`
    - *overlay* : Avoiding name conflicts and organizing code in large projects with namespaces. Namespaces provide a way to group logically related objects and functions under a named scope.
    - NameSpaces
- `g_classes`
    - *overlay* : Transitioning from procedural to object-oriented programming by encapsulating data and functionality within classes ,  benefits of using header files for class declarations to enhance modularity and code organization , Why it is needed when we have functions and namespaces
    - file with main.cpp
    - single cpp
    - using header files
    - Classes , headers
- `h_templates`
    - *overlay* : Learn how to write flexible and reusable functions and classes that can operate on different data types while maintaining type safety.
    - Templates
- `i_libraries`
    - *overlay* : Leveraging the power of existing libraries to extend functionality without reinventing the wheel
    - integerate popular -> show them process of line following
    - create custom libraries
- `j_multi_libs_cmakelist`
    - *overlay* : Managing complex projects with multiple libraries using CMake. Strategies for organizing, linking, and managing dependencies
    - Multiple libraries
- `k_pointers`
    - *overlay* : from raw pointers to smart pointers. Explore how pointers are used to manage memory and resources, and how smart pointers can automate memory management to prevent leaks.
    - Pointers , simple and shared
- `l_jargons`
    - *overlay* :
    - Jargons recap
        - include directives
        - Variables
        - Member
        - Constants
        - Functions
        - Namespaces
        - Classes
        - SharedPtr: A typedef for a shared pointe
        - create_publisher<> : templates
- `n_style_docs`
    - *overlay* :
